Two simple scripts for helping with CouchDB clustering and parallelization:

=Slipcover

- run a single query across a multi-member cluser (i.e. a group of CouchDBs) and zip up the results

=California King

- run a series of queries in parallel against a single CouchDB

=Details

Checkout slipcover.doctest and california_king.doctest for usage and explanation.

To run the doctests:

  gem install rubydoctest
  cd slipcover
  rubydoctest doctest/*.doctest
